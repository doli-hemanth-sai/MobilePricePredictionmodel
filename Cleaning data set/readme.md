This project focuses on data cleaning using Python and several essential libraries. The dataset is cleaned to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and proper format, enabling better analysis and visualization. The following libraries are used for data cleaning:

NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large arrays and mathematical functions.

Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, enabling the use of data frames and series for efficient cleaning.

Matplotlib: A popular visualization library used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: A high-level interface to Matplotlib that provides attractive and informative statistical graphics.

data: Contains the input ds.csv and the output mobilesdf.csv obtained after data cleaning.

notebooks: Contains the Jupyter Notebook dataset_cleaning.ipynb demonstrating the data cleaning process.
